# World-Economic-GDP
Created Visualization using MICROSOFT tool PowerBI.
It is very to use and understand. I also have learnt Power BI by going on some documentation of it and also got some help from the tutorials uploaded on internet.
I am pasting the direct link to the IMF's official site from where you can get the data , and also customize it according to your wish. 
"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2021/April".

I have used the data from 1980's to 2021 april and applied many of the visualiztions.
